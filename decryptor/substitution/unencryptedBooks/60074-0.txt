                          _INTRODUCTORY NOTE_


_These cartoons have been reprinted in the hope that they may have a
permanent interest because of the great historical importance of the
period they encompass. In the last two or three years the world has
moved with more than its usual alacrity. It has been a history-making
epoch. There has been a war that WAS a war. There have been disasters
almost without parallel; and we have weathered as pleasant a
presidential campaign as the oldest inhabitant can remember. Mr.
Roosevelt has been insured to us for another four years and his
activities in peace and in war and in sports have been a source of
unending inspiration to the cartoonist. In addition, the nation has
achieved merited glory because of the great exposition held in St.
Louis, and last, but not least, Missouri has taken it into her head to
go Republican._

_The importance of these affairs is our excuse for hoping that the
cartoons appearing in this collection may have more than an ephemeral
interest, and with respectful humility, we hereby dedicate them to that
grand old man—sometimes so foolish but always so well-meaning—our Uncle
Sam._

                    SOCIAL HAPPENINGS AT BIRD CENTER

Since the war in the Far East began, there has been more or less
interest evinced by our townsmen in the great struggle. Consequently,
when some of our prominent citizens suggested that a talk be given by
Captain Fry on the subject, everybody enthusiastically seconded the
proposition. The gallant captain, himself a keen student of military
strategy, as well as a hero of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and a thousand
other equally noted battles, promised to give the talk and, in fact, did
give it at the Opera House last Friday evening. Mr. Smiley Green, the
popular undertaker, introduced the speaker with a few timely and
well-chosen remarks, after which Captain Fry launched vigorously into
his subject.

“First, I want to explain what has led up to the present aggravated
condition of affairs in the Far East. For many years Russia has slowly
but surely been expanding to the eastward, until she is now in
possession of all northern Asia. But she has no outlook to the sea for
her commerce, except the ice-bound port of Vladivostok way up yonder
[pointing to the map]. She is like a great wheat field full of grain
with no gate to get the grain out. So what does she do? She decides to
get a port farther south. When Japan licked the Chinese in ’94, and
captured Port Arthur and a good part of Manchuria, Russia gets France
and Germany to protest against Japan’s retaining Port Arthur. They
protest and Japan is cheated out of the spoils of war. Then Russia
quietly leases Port Arthur from the Chinese for twenty-five years and
moves in. She doesn’t think England will stand for her action, but
England had a weak Prime Minister, and no protest was made. Of all the
nations of the earth, Russia was the most surprised to find that she was
to be allowed to keep Port Arthur. So she proceeded to fortify and
prepared to stay a good deal longer than her lease called for. Japan is
sore, but all the powers were against her. Russia then decides that she
must have all the land between Port Arthur and Siberia, so she proceeds
to occupy Manchuria. When anybody protested she said she was going to
get out day after to-morrow, but she didn’t calculate to. She had worked
a bluff at Port Arthur, so why not work another for Manchuria? Japan was
foxy and saw how it would come out if she didn’t step in and register a
kick. So she demands that Russia move out and Russia says ‘Certainly,’
but when moving day came, Russia couldn’t find the moving man. Instead
of that, she moved a few thousand soldiers in and hung up a sign, ‘We
are here to stay.’ Then Japan began to oil up her musket. ‘If Russia is
allowed to do as she pleases out here, she will soon have Japan in the
corner pocket,’ she says, ‘and Japan wants at least a little room to
roll around in. We don’t propose to have a big man with a gun leaning up
against us on the starboard side, so here’s where we get busy.’ So Japan
prepares for fight, but Russia doesn’t think she is in earnest. She
calls Japan a little pigmy and delays rolling up her sleeve. At that
moment Japan inaugurated what Mr. Gus Figgey would call ‘Rough House’
and lands on Russia at Port Arthur with the result that Russia wakes up
to find her solar plexus dislocated.”

At this point in Captain Fry’s speech there were loud shouts of
approval, in the midst of which could be heard the voice of Gus Figgey
ringing out in strident tones, “Hot stuff, Cap.”

“And now what is a-goin’ to happen?” resumed Captain Fry. “I will tell
you. Japan is a-goin’ to land a couple regiments on this what’s-its-name
peninsula, destroy the railway, and cut the line of communication to
Port Arthur. Then she can plant her siege guns on the hills back of the
town and throw in a few hundred ton of grape and canister until the
garrison capitulates. Then the Japs can march up through Manchoory,
capture the Siberian railway and in six weeks capture St. Petersburg.
The Japs already have Sayool down yonder in Corea, and can bombard the
Yayloo River when they’re a mind to.”

Many of the audience congratulated Captain Fry on his address, and
assured him that they now could intelligently follow the news from the
war.

                                 No. 1.

WABASH, IND., JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Chris Newbower and Gus Nelson, two
prominent citizens of this city, report having sighted the Vladivostok
squadron last evening, steaming slowly down the Wabash River. Both men
are citizens of considerable veracity, one having formerly been the
circulation manager of the Wabash _Palladium_ and the other a prominent
politician. People here are inclined to credit the report. Mr. Newbower
states positively that he saw three large ships steaming so near that he
could distinctly see the masts. Mr. Nelson saw six ships, having
probably looked twice. Intense excitement prevails here as there is a
neutral river flatboat nine weeks overdue. It is feared the Russian
ships may have overtaken it.

                                 No. 2.

HENDERSON, KY., JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Col. Bunker H. Breckenridge, who is
spending the summer at his home in this city, reports having seen the
Vladivostok squadron lying off the Kentucky shore of the Ohio yesterday
afternoon. The colonel doesn’t remember the number of ships but says the
number corresponded with that of the Russian fleet. The report can be
easily verified, says the colonel, by his grandson who also witnessed
the squadron. Great excitement prevails and the matter is the topic of
general conversation. The sheriff is organizing a posse of colonels to
guard the city in case local shipping is threatened.

                                 No. 3.

ST. JOSEPH, MICH., JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Mr. H. Close of Chicago, who has
been Sundaying in this city, reports seeing the Vladivostok squadron
last evening three miles east of this city. Mr. Close was sitting on the
shore thinking about the political situation, when some one near by
called his attention to the squadron. He says that he saw it distinctly,
but didn’t notice how many ships there were, or what direction they were
going. Mr. Close states that he is going down again to-night to watch
for the squadron. Intense excitement prevails. Little knots of bridal
couples may be seen earnestly discussing the sensation.

                                 No. 4.

JOILET, ILL., JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Mr. Herbert X. Bughaus of this city came
running into the city early this morning crying out that he had been
pursued by the Vladivostok Squadron. He first saw it near the rolling
mills and stopped for some minutes to count the ships. He counted six
the first time, but a recount showed nine. A Russian admiral commanded
him to surrender, but Mr. Bughaus retreated quickly followed by the
entire squadron. Fortunately he reached the city safely, although
terribly frightened. In an interview Mr. B. stated that he saw the ships
while on his way home or to work, he is not sure which. Great excitement
prevails.

                                 No. 5.

PUNTA ARENAS, ARGENTINE REPUBLIC, JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Izaak Walton Jones,
a citizen of this city, reports having sighted the Vladivostok squadron
three miles and a quarter off Cape Horn, about noon to-day. He first saw
the fleet come down the east coast of South America, turn abruptly
around the Horn and disappear rapidly up the west coast. There were
three large ships and they were traveling thirty knots an hour. When
last seen they were turning the corner two miles north of Valparaiso.
Mr. Jones at once brought the news to this city, and, after renewing his
supplies, will return to the cape where he is fishing.

                                 No. 6.

DUNDEE, SCOTLAND, JULY 27—(SPECIAL)—Mr. Jem Wethersby, first officer of
the Peruvian bark Calisaya, arrived here this afternoon with the report
that he found evidences of the Vladivostok squadron. At seven bells
night before last, while doing his trick at the watch, he passed a large
piece of wreckage which, he swears, was probably part of a vessel sunk
by the what’s-its-name squadron. Mr. Wethersby has had much experience
in swearing, having been a mate on a tramp steamer for twelve years.
Late this evening we endeavored to get a complete story from Mr. W., but
he was not to be found.

[Illustration:

  MARGATE, ENGLAND, OCT. 24—(SPECIAL)—_The Eddystone light-house was
    attacked last night by the Baltic fleet and totally annihilated. It
    is thought the Russian admiral mistook it for a fleet of Japanese
    airships._
]


[Illustration:

  DOVER, ENGLAND, OCT. 24—(SPECIAL)—_Late last night a man standing on
    the English coast sou-sou’west of this place lighted a match to see
    what time it was. He was instantly attacked by the Baltic fleet, the
    admiral of which mistook the light for a Japanese signal. Three
    twelve-inch shells grazed the astonished gentleman, but fortunately
    none struck him. An ultimatum is probable._
]


[Illustration:

  CHERBOURG, FRANCE, OCT. 24—(SPECIAL)—_Heavy cannonading was heard
    several miles off this coast last night. A French cruiser at once
    put out to the scene of the noise and found the Baltic fleet
    attacking the north star. It is thought the vigilant admiral mistook
    the light for a fleet of Japanese battleships. An ultimatum is
    expected hourly._
]


[Illustration:

  FINISTERRE, FRANCE, OCT. 25, 3:30
  A.M.—(SPECIAL)—_At an early hour this morning the Baltic fleet was
    seen steaming swiftly past this point. Soon afterwards a furious
    bombardment occurred and continued until the body of an electric eel
    was washed ashore much mangled by the deadly cannonading. It is
    thought the admiral of the fleet mistook the eel for a Japanese
    submarine boat. At the present writing the fleet is bombarding a
    drug store down near the beach. The druggist is issuing an
    ultimatum._

                  THE THRILLING STORY OF THE CHINA SEA

[Illustration]

ADMIRAL ROJESTVENSKY STOOD MUSINGLY ON HIS FLAGSHIP—_“One load more,” he
muttered sadly, “and then our fleet will be coaled and I must leave this
pleasant coast.” For a moment a tear stood in his eye as he peered off
toward the French China shore. The thought of leaving the dear old
scenes, to which he had become so greatly attached, made even the stern
old sailor weep. Dashing aside the tear, he turned to direct the busy
crew who were bringing the coal to the ships._

_“Come, my hearties,” he cried, “step lively. We must get away.”_

_With these few words, so pregnant of meaning, our hero turned his eyes
toward the great leviathans of the deep. Smoke rolled in mighty volumes
from their funnels and went whirling off in the howling gale. A thousand
cannon strained their cyclopean eyes to the northward; 10,000 Russian
tars crouched defiantly at the breech blocks._


                  THESE WERE THE MEN BEHIND THE GUNS!


FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE ADMIRAL STOOD THERE IN DEEP CONTEMPLATION,
LISTENING TO THE SHOUTING SEAS AND THE SCREAMING OF THE WINDS. THEN,
TURNING SLOWLY, HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE BRIDGE—_“Anything in sight?” he
inquired of a bystander._

_“Forty ships off the port bow, sir. All steamers, sir, but I can’t make
out their colors.”_

_“Humph,” said the admiral, in Russian. “Fishing boats, probably,” and
dismissed the matter from his thoughts._

AGAIN HE TURNED HIS EYES SHOREWARD AND ANOTHER TEAR APPEARED—_“Ah,” he
mused, “I have been so happy here. If my weekly paper had not come so
irregularly of late I should be perfectly happy here. Heigh ho, I must
not yield to sentiment in this manner.”_

A THOUGHT THEN STRUCK HIM AND HE TURNED TO GIVE AN ORDER TO A HANDSOME
BYSTANDER WEARING SPURS—_“I’ll pipe all hands below and give my men a
night’s rest.”_

_In the twinkling of an eye the wireless telegraph was sending forth the
glad news, and a moment later 10,000 Russians tars were peacefully
sleeping in their hammocks. A great silence lay over the mighty
battleships._

               From the lips of the youngster standing near;

              “Johnnie Jones!” and a silence fell

               “Charley Jones!” at the call there came
               Two ambulance men and some doleful groans
               As they bore in the body of Charley Jones,
              Greatly disfigured, to answer his name.

   PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT HAS BEEN MADE AN HONORARY COLONEL OF A BRITISH
                                REGIMENT

[Illustration:

  EXTRACT FROM “LONDON TIMES,” AUGUST 18, 1911—_In the war maneuvres
    yesterday, Honorary Colonel Roosevelt, of the Brixton Rough Riders,
    led his regiment in an extraordinarily fine charge up Ludgate Hill,
    arriving at the top some hours before his regiment. The king
    witnessed the charge from a safe position on the obelisk. There was
    quite a panic in Lombard Street, many of the leading financiers
    hastily retiring to Hyde Park upon hearing that the gallant colonel
    was to make the charge. Some of them are still missing, but
    doubtless will soon be found. One hundred and sixty women fainted,
    nineteen horses ran away, and one unfortunate man had his leg broken
    while trying to climb Trafalgar Monument. The dome of St. Paul’s
    will be repaired within the next fortnight._

    Workmen.

    Sir:—

    Your letter received. Personally, I consider the request that
    you make should more appropriately be presented to the mayor or
    your city. At the same time I cannot miss this opportunity to
    say a few things about labor organizations in general. I think
    organized labor is a serious menace to the welfare of our
    institutions; and I further think that any man who belongs to a
    Union should be treated as a criminal. There is no good in
    Unions. Every man who belongs to one is worse than an anarchist.
    If I am elected my first official act shall be to have every man
    who belongs to a labor union expelled from the country or
    de-naturalized. Furthermore, I think that men who work for a
    living have no license to live anyway.

         Yours respectfully, Theodore Rosefelt [** signature]

    Dear Friend:—

    Thanks for your very friendly letter. I am much encouraged by
    the news you send and am very glad to hear that the sentiment is
    so favorable to me. John D. called on me yesterday and left a
    substantial check, which, of course, will not be recorded in his
    name. It is needless to say that if I am elected my gratitude
    will assure a very substantial form and my friends in Wall
    Street need never fear that their prosperity will be jeopardized
    by any official act of mine. I shall be in New York Saturday and
    should like to see you privately at the Metropolitan Club. Mr.
    Baer, of the Reading Road, will also join us there.

    I regret very much that I cannot manage to speak before the

    engagement with the President of the Michigan Northern Road and
    cannot break it. Please express my regrets and say that I hope

    Dear Son-in-Law:—

    I shall be home Thursday. Am very tired and worn out. I do not
    believe that I can keep up this pace for six months more. My
    back aches, I fainted from over-exhaustion yesterday, and the
    only food I can eat is pre-digested milk. Please have Murphy,
    the foreman of the mine, discharge the laborers who are
    agitating for higher wages. We are now paying them 80 cents a
    day and what can these ignorant German and Irish laborers
    expect? They never earned that much at home and yet they dare to
    come over here and make these preposterous demands. I never
    could tolerate the Germans and Irish anyway. However, do not
    mention this fact before election day.

    get up at three o’clock and sit in the dark thinking it out. I
    didn’t dare light a light for fear Mr. Yerkes would find me and sell
    me some stock. Finally, one morning, about half-past four I got it
    all thought out except where the stockholders come in, and just then
    Mr. Yerkes and Mrs. Chadwick rode in on two white giraffes with a
    trunk full of stocks. So I ran down the street yelling, and some one
    suggested a nice, quiet upholstered room where I would be safe. So I
    came here and you mustn’t tell Mr. Yerkes where I am. And now I’ve
    got it all thought out. You first have to multiply Port Arthur by
    the new Chicago Post Office and carry two. Then you subtract and let
    stand in a cool place until you become impatient, and that’s the
    answer._”

         SOME HAPPY LITTLE VACATION SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR READERS


SUGGESTION I—Charter a good, seaworthy steam-yacht, stock it well with
seasonable food and drink, and cruise along the New England coast.
Frequent stops may be made at the various watering places, thus
pleasantly breaking the voyage. After having exhausted these points of
interest, you will find it enjoyable to continue the cruise to Sweden
and Norway, and, if your time permits, a still further cruise among the
beautiful fjords of New Zealand will be found extremely delightful. The
weather is now perfect in New Zealand, and if you have a camera you can
get some most excellent pictures. For a trip such as this one should
secure a steam-yacht of perhaps 2,500 tons, with a crew of thirty men. A
white yacht is preferable, white being cooler than black. If you do not
mind the additional expense, a cow should be taken, thus insuring fresh
milk during the voyage. As for equipment, you should take heavy and
light clothes, a pair of deck shoes, a mackintosh, and a pair of smoked
glasses to protect your eyes while going through the Suez Canal. The
cost of this outing will amply repay you for your pleasure, and we
strongly recommend it.

                  *       *       *       *       *

SUGGESTION II—Another delightful vacation which we earnestly recommend
would be to spend your two weeks’ holiday in Scotland. Here one may rent
a beautiful estate, abundantly stocked with game—croquet, golf, bridge,
etc.,—and with plenty of good riding-horses, and at least one mail coach
for coaching parties, the hours may be most delightfully beguiled. You
could give frequent entertainments, such as jolly little tours in the
highlands, etc., and it would be well to have the castle the scene of
many congenial house parties. Occasionally you should give lawn fêtes to
which the peasants and tenants from the neighboring countryside may be
invited.

Such an estate may easily be secured by going through the necessary
preliminaries. You should insist, however, that your London agents
secure a castle with a porch well screened with mosquito bars. The cost
of such a place would be either moderate or upwards.

As the highlands are often cool during the evening hours, you should
take a heavy overcoat and at least one suit of flannels.

                  *       *       *       *       *

SUGGESTION III—Our third suggestion would be to make up a jolly little
party and spend your July vacation in touring Switzerland and the
Petroleum Alps. Excellent motor-cars may be obtained in Paris (No. 19
Arc de Triomphe) and the roads from the gay capital to the Swiss uplands
will be found most excellent. Luncheon may be secured at convenient
cabarets along the way, and by speaking to the chauffeur stops may be
made from time to time to allow you to make photographs of choice bits
in the landscape. Arriving in Switzerland, you should retire early in
order to be up for the sunrise, which, in those latitudes is much
earlier than in America on account of the difference in time.

While in Switzerland you should not fail to visit the tomb of William
Tell, who is dead at present. Here a short stop may be made for
luncheon, photographs, etc. In this little side trip you will have
delightful weather, according to recent unconfirmed rumors from Chefoo.

Having toured Switzerland, it would be pleasant to have a yacht meet you
some place nearby and make the homeward journey in this way rather than
by the Atlantic liners. There are so many vulgar tourists on the regular
steamships during the summer.

                           BIRD CENTER ABROAD

                            FIRST INSTALMENT

IT is with pleasure that ye Editor chronicles the announcement that a
goodly quota of Bird Center society leaders purpose taking a European
tour ere long. Among those who will constitute the pilgrimage are Mrs.
Riley Withersby, our beloved leader of local society, Reverend Walpole
and wife and children under nine years of age, Captain Roscoe Fry and
wife, Mr. J. Milton Brown and wife (née Lucile Ramona Fry, formerly
daughter of Captain Fry), and little J. Milton Brown, Jr. Also Mr.
Smiley Greene, the popular undertaker, and wife and children, Mr. Riley
Peters and Miss Myrtle Prute, of Muncie, Indiana, the Misses Flossye and
Mae Niebling, Mr. Ernest Pratt, Mr. Elmer Pratt, Mr. Wilbur Fry, and Mr.
Orville Peters. Quite a goodly party, say you not?

It is safe to say without exaggeration that the local social circles are
agog with pleasant anticipation. At first it was understood that only
Mrs. Withersby contemplated going abroad, and for that reason she gave a
small function last evening to announce the fact, but others volunteered
to accompany her and the party grew apace quite rapidly.

Late in the evening, just before refreshments were served, Mr. Gus
Figgey of Chicago arrived and joined the group.

“I just came in on the hundred-hour limited from Decatur,” he announced
buoyantly, “and thought I’d drift up and join the merrymakers. What’s
going on?”

Mrs. Withersby explained that some of the party were talking over a trip
to Europe.

“Count me in,” said Mr. Figgey. “I haven’t had a vacation for three
years and I’m going to have one this year if the country goes plumb to
smash. What’s the route?”

“We have planned to go to Scotland and the English Lakes,” said Mrs.
Withersby pleasantly.

“I can figure out a better trip than that,” said Mr. Figgey. “First
we’ll go to London and show those Britishers a touch of high life, then
skip over to Paris, thence to Venice, and circle around to Rome. Them’s
the four great show places of Europe, and no tour is complete without
’em.”

“But, Mr. Figgey—”

“Now, I’ll tell what we’ll do,” said the genial Mr. Figgey. “I’ll get
some inside rates from a friend of mine in the importing business, and
I’ll guarantee that when we get through, Europe will feel that she’s
been seen good and proper.”

“Have you ever been abroad, Mr. Figgey?” inquired Mrs. J. Milton Brown.

“No, but I’ve traveled all over this country, making all the important
towns, and what I don’t know about traveling could be put in an
expurgated French novel.”

“I’d like to stop at Niagara Falls, Mr. Figgey,” said Elmer Pratt.

“Sure, the train slows down there and we can see the Falls just as well
as if you spent an hour.”

“And won’t it be beautiful in Venice,” said Miss Myrtle Prute. “I’ve
always been crazy to see Venice by moonlight.”

“We’ll see it by moonlight, candlelight and daylight, Miss Prute.
Orville and Wilbur can take their mandolins and we’ll have a tune on the
dancing waters. Hot stuff, eh?” said Mr. Figgey, slapping Reverend
Walpole on the back.

The party adjourned at a late hour, Mr. Figgey promising to arrange all
the details, etc. Various members of the party will tell their
experiences exclusively in the Bird Center _Argosy_.

                                                     NIAGARA FALLS, JULY

         (Special Correspondence of the Bird Center _Argosy_.)

MIDST gay acclaim did the Bird Center personally conducted tour to
Europe steam out of Bird Center yesterday morn. The bells cried “Off to
Europe,” and the rails clicked the same news as the great steam steed
started on the long journey to Niagara Falls. Throngs of people got on
and off at every station, and many admiring glances were cast at the
Bird Center tourists who, massed together, made quite a noticeable
effect. Mr. Gus Figgey, who says he is the chaperon of the party, has
made the welkin ring with laughter and gaiety. At the first stop he
purchased oranges for the crowd, and later in the day entertained them
with personal anecdotes of travel. At the second stop Mr. Figgey
addressed the town from the rear platform, and received a rousing round
of cheers. Last evening he entertained ye Editor at supper in the
dining-car. It has been a beautiful trip.

Niagara Falls was reached without further mishap. These Falls are
situated on the Niagara River, between the Canadian side and the United
States. They are a hundred and sixty-two feet in height and are
considered by competent critics to be one of America’s most famous
natural beauties. The train stopped twenty minutes and Mr. Figgey had
several fast hacks convey the party to the various points of interest.
By way of getting an expression of opinion from the various members of
the party, the Editor secured short statements for the readers of the
_Argosy_.

“Great sight,” said Mr. Figgey. “Those Falls have power enough to run
all the factories in the U. S. A.”

“A notable sight,” said Mrs. Riley Withersby.

“More impressive than Dante’s ‘Inferno,’” said Mrs. J. Milton Brown.

“A masterpiece of Nature,” said Reverend Walpole.

“Unequalled in history,” said Wilbur Fry.

“Fine, but wait till you see Saint Peter’s in Rome,” said Mr. Ernest
Pratt, who was in Europe several years ago.

“Too bad I can’t get a good photo of it. The Falls would make a
beautiful moving picture,” said Mr. J. Milton Brown.

“Truly a sublime spectacle,” said Mr. Smiley Greene, the popular
undertaker.

“Gosh!” said Elmer Pratt.

It was with mingled feelings of sadness that ye Editor saw the gay party
steam eastward, as he was obliged for business reasons to return to Bird
Center. Other communications from members of the party will be printed
from time to time.

THE Editor of the Bird Center _Argosy_ presents the following letter
from Mrs. J. Milton Brown, who is en route abroad in the personally
conducted Bird Center tour.

                                                J. OSCAR FISHER, Editor.

                                                          AT SEA, AUGUST

“She moves, she throbs, she seems to feel the thrill of life upon her
keel.” At last the great Leviathan of the Deep has left the dock amid
waving ‘kerchiefs and loud huzzas. Like great mountain ranges, rising
tier upon tier, the vast buildings of Gotham looked down upon the
gallant ship as she turns her course toward the vast and trackless deep.
Beautiful somber tints stretch from horizon upward, blending into the
deep blue of Heaven’s own firmament. Dainty white caps assail the
towering walls of steel that are to be our home for so many days.
Bartholdi’s peerless statue, with hand uplifted, seems to cast its
benedictions on us as we start for those distant shores to the eastward,
and Nature smiles fondly upon us as America’s shores sink lower and
lower, back in the direction of dear Bird Center. What joy it is to
breathe this ocean air, unsullied by smoke, undefiled by foreign matter.
Eyes are flashing with renewed invigoration, hearts are light as the
giant of the sea swings into the easy roll of the long Atlantic billows.
Spindrift whips by as a great wave, more saucy than its sisters, assails
the reeling bow. The splendid craft trembles but goes onward, ever
onward, its propellers singing their endless song of struggle. Mr.
Figgey, immaculate and white-flanneled, is quite the dressiest passenger
on board, and is constantly the cynosure of all eyes. See how he swings
along the deck, perfect sailor that he is. Now the rollers batter more
furiously, as Mr. Figgey approaches, cigar in mouth, to tell us to get
busy and have a good time. The ship rolls and wallows—”

THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center
_Argosy_ the following travel-paper from Mr. Gus Figgey, the genial
Chicago traveling man who is being accompanied by social leaders of this
City in their tour abroad.

                                                J. OSCAR FISHER, Editor.


                                                    LONDON, JULY —, 1842

I have dated this back to fit the occasion. Of all the slow burgs, this
is the slowest. Had to wait three minutes for an elevator at the hotel
and ten minutes longer to reach the sixth floor. I told the Britisher at
the desk what the trouble with London was, but he didn’t believe me.
Merely raised his eye-brows, but I’ll raise something else if things
don’t move along a little faster here before long. Took the bunch out
for a ride in a herdic to-day. Saw the Strand, not to be mentioned in
the same year with State Street in old Chicag. Elmer Pratt said he
reckoned there must be a show in town, judging by the crowd in the
streets. Took ’em to see the Alhambra, but Reverend Walpole said it
wasn’t a bit like what he thought the Alhambra was like, judging from
something he read by Henry Irving. Have had a hard time keeping the
folks _en masse_, as the Frenchies say. Mrs. J. Milton wanted to go to a
picture gallery to see the Turners, but I told her I’d take her around
to the Tivoli and show her some turns that were turns. Reverend Walpole
wanted to go to the Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul’s, but from what I
heard a man on the steamer say, they are old buildings, out of date and
furnished with tombstones. When I want any reading, you’ll have to pass
me something livelier than epitaphs. Elmer Pratt wanted to see London
Bridge, he heard it was falling down. If there was a Lake Front here,
Elmer would be down there looking at the explosion. I took the party
down to see Trafalgar’s monument, and pointed it out to them. Have lost
Riley Peters and Myrtle Prute, but I suppose they’ll turn up at supper
time. We’ve been here two days, and have done the town thoroughly. Leave
to-morrow for gay Paris. Can’t hold Smiley Greene. Orville Peters and
Wilbur Fry are anxious to get to Venus, where they can play their
mandolins on the raging canal. Ernest Pratt is blasé on the trip, having
been over here before. Says Europe is an old story to him. Get my name
spelled right, Oscar. Be sure to get in the “e.”

THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center
_Argosy_ the following travel-paper from Mr. Smiley Greene, our popular
undertaker, who is doing Europe with a party of travelers from this
city.

                                                J. OSCAR FISHER, Editor.


                                                          PARIS, AUGUST.

In Paris, France, at last! France, the gay, the light-hearted; France,
the country with a history! Every wall has its tale of war and
revolution and death. Placards reading “Defense d’Afficher” mark where
notable defenses, back in some dark days of the past, have been made by
gallant sons of Gaul. Captain Fry says Gaul is divided into three parts,
not counting Gus Figgey. Gus says some one ought to consolidate them
into a union. We have been having considerable trouble with the
language, as they all speak the foreign tongue here, so that even by
shouting at the top of your lungs, you can’t make them understand.
Lucile Ramona Brown tried her French on them, but they didn’t even
understand that. She seems to get her accents on the wrong words.

Paris never was more beautiful, even although we understand that most of
the society people have gone away for the summer. You can’t help pitying
these Europeans, for they can’t go abroad for the summer, being already
there. Went out to visit the Morgue to-day. Busiest place of its kind
I’ve ever seen. Visited Napoleon’s tomb this afternoon, and consider it
a most imposing place. Mr. Figgey tells us that the departed is a
relative of the new United States Secretary of the Navy, a fact which
has aroused great interest in our midst. Yesterday we drove out to
witness the Arch of Triumph, which was greatly enjoyed by all save
Ernest Pratt, to whom Europe is an old story, he having been here
before. To-morrow we go out to view Père la Chaise, the famous cemetery
of Paris. It is said that many well-known Frenchmen and French women
sleep their last sleep out there, so we have cautioned Gus Figgey to put
on the soft pedal for a short spell. Ernest Pratt says Abelard and
Hèloise lie there, but whether they are two people or a firm I cannot
state. Visited the Louvre yesterday and saw the Venus of Milo, which
greatly shocked Elmer Pratt. Gus Figgey says her arms were guillotined
during the French Revolution, but be it as it may, she certainly is shy
on arms. Orville Peters and Wilbur Fry are eager to get to Venice to
while away the hours with dulcet strains from their mandolins, but
Ernest Pratt says, “Wait till we see Saint Peter’s.” To-morrow we view
the Catacombs and the Cemetery of Montmartre.

Everybody is well and happy. More anon.

                            SIXTH INSTALMENT

THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center
_Argosy_ the following travel-paper from Mrs. J. Milton Brown, the wife
of J. Milton Brown, the well-known artist of the Bird Center Tintype
Studios.

                                                J. OSCAR FISHER, Editor.


                                           VENICE THE ENCHANTING, AUG. —

At last we are in the well-known city of Venice, Italy, about which our
fancies have from time immemorial woven the most bewitching dreams. It
is hard to realize that we are really here. We instantly exclaim, “Can
it really be true that we are in Venice, and not merely dreaming.” Mr.
Figgey—he’s so funny—says that we’ll not think we’re dreaming when we
get our hotel bill. Mr. Figgey is so material in his attitude of
thought, but he has been a perfect dear in arranging things. He doesn’t
let us rest a moment, and even now, when we have been here only two
days, he seems to know all the gondoliers and everybody in town knows
him. He calls all the gondoliers “Louey,” and they begin to grin broadly
whenever he comes in sight. We had such a good joke on Elmer Pratt
to-day. We came across a little church near the hotel and Elmer went
into raptures over it. It’s whole façade was one bewildering nightmare
of scroll work and curly cues, like frosting on a wedding cake. Elmer
said that he considered it the most beautiful thing he had seen in
Europe, and at once looked it up in our Baedeker. The description says
that it is the most atrociously ugly building in Europe, and since then
Elmer has not admired anything until he has looked in the guide book to
see whether it is beautiful.

Last night we engaged some gondolas and did the grand canal. The moon
was divine, and the whole city was throbbing with music and sentiment.
Mr. Figgey directed the excursion and after a while took charge of the
oar or paddle (I don’t know what the real name is) and gave the
gondolier some lessons in the work. Smiley Greene sang some rollicking
hymns, and then we all clamored for Orville Peters and Wilbur Fry to
play on their mandolins. They had carried their instruments all the way
from Bird Center and had counted the seconds to the present moment. But
scarcely had they begun to play before some men came and said it was not
permitted for outsiders to play on the canals. Only those belonging to
the Gondoliers’ Union could play. Orville and Wilbur were
broken-hearted. We had been out for some time before we discovered that
Riley Peters and Myrtle Prute were missing, but, Mr. Figgey soon located
them in a gondola by themselves. Riley seems to be in earnest this time,
but now could any one help being in earnest, and in love, in Venice.
Even all of us become a little bit soft here—even us old married people.
Flossye Niebling has been spending all her time writing letters home.
The stationery at the hotels is so attractive and she doesn’t want to
miss a chance to use it.

From here we go to Rome. We are all well and beautifully tanned.

                           SEVENTH INSTALMENT

THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center
_Argosy_ the following travel-paper from Mr. Gus Figgey, the genial
Chicago traveling gentleman, who is traveling in Europe with society
leaders from Bird Center.

                                                J. OSCAR FISHER, Editor.


                                                            ROME, AUG. —

This burg isn’t half bad. In some of the new parts of town you’d think
you were in Chicago. They have buildings here eight and ten stories
high, and the old fogy part of the city is fast disappearing. A good
hustling Commissioner of Public Works could soon make Rome look as
up-to-date as any of our American cities. Rome is only about a third as
big as Chicago, although it was started long before. To-day we did two
miles of picture galleries and saw paintings which, if put together,
would make one painting a mile square. I priced some of them but didn’t
buy. Reverend Walpole has been right in his element here and has visited
about ninety-seven churches. Smiley Greene has spent most of his time in
the Catacombs and J. Milton Brown and Lucile have reveled in art. The
party is all split up. They refused to go out to the Race Track with me,
and I have had a hard time entertaining them. Yesterday we all went in a
bunch to see St. Peter’s. Say, there’s a building for you. Ernest Pratt
says it’s the greatest building in the world, and he’s been in Europe
before. I guess he saw it when it was new; for now it is showing signs
of age. When I got the crowd in front of the church, I had ’em stand all
in a row while I went on in front to give ’em an idea of how big the
building really is. You can’t realize its size until you compare it with
a man standing at the door. They were much surprised to see how small I
looked.

To-morrow we sail from Naples for New York, and before many days you
will see us drifting into Bird Center, all sound and well. Riley Peters
and Myrtle Prute are engaged. Venice and the moon did it. Riley’s hot
stuff, all right.

                                                         MR. GUS FIGGEY.

     I—CAN GOV. YATES GET BACK IN TIME TO HEAD OFF THE DENEEN BOOM?

BEING THE ADVENTURES OF OUR GOVERNOR, WHO, WHILE TRAVELING IN FOREIGN
LANDS HEARD OF THE REMARKABLE GROWTH OF DENEEN’S BOOM FOR GOVERNOR. HE
RESOLVED AT ONCE TO FLY TO THE RESCUE, AND, WITH HIS GALLANT STAFF OF
COLONELS, HE BOLDLY SET FORTH ON THE LONG AND PERILOUS RIDE

[Illustration:

  _In the midst of pleasant sightseeing in Europe a cablegram arrives._
]


[Illustration:

  _It contains the alarming news of the growth of the Deneen boom for
    governor._
]


[Illustration:

  _Whereupon the governor and his gallant staff of colonels begin a
    thrilling ride, compared to which the ride of General Sheridan
    resembled a franc and a half._
]


[Illustration:

  _At frequent intervals the governor cheered his escort onward by words
    of hope and encouragement._
]




------------------------------------------------------------------------


    II—GOV. YATES’ WILD DASH FROM EUROPE TO HEAD OFF THE DEENEN BOOM

[Illustration:

  _For many days the way was easy, and no mishaps attended them until
    they arrived at the foothills of a vast mountain range. An
    unfortunate mishap then occurred. One of the colonels was overcome
    and had to be borne along on the back of his steed thereby greatly
    lessening the speed of the gallant little band. Despite this
    untoward accident, the governor led bravely onward, ever crying out:
    “Courage, my comrades! Courage! We shall soon be there!”_
]


[Illustration:

  _Thus inspired they began the ascent. A vast solitude surrounded them!
    No sign of life met their eye, save where some distant mountain goat
    disported himself on the dizzy peaks, or where some adventurous
    eagle clung high in the Alpine crags. The hardships of traveling now
    became extreme, provisions gave out and for many weeks the little
    cavalcade were obliged to subsist upon eagles and mountain goats,
    which, owing to the peculiar formation of the country were difficult
    to catch, and more difficult to shoot, as the colonels were
    unaccustomed to the use of firearms. When they reached an altitude
    of 19,000 feet, another colonel was overcome and had to be carried
    along with his stricken comrade, for the governor resolved not to
    abandon his devoted follower in the mountain fastness as a prey to
    the savage goats._
]


[Illustration:

  _Upon the nineteenth day of the ascent the last colonel gave out, and
    the governor carefully placed him upon the horse parallel with the
    two other exhausted colonels. A few days after this fresh misfortune
    the little band reached the summit, 42,000 feet above the sea level.
    A magnificent view of the surrounding continent was obtained, and
    largely repaid for the hardships of the ascent. Behind lay the peaks
    that they had crossed, many of them rising to a height of 30,000
    feet or more. Down at their feet lay the broad, convex bosom of the
    Atlantic Ocean. A happy thought struck the governor. “I remind
    myself of Balboa discovering the Pacific,” he said with a smile, but
    if his followers heard this merry quip they gave no heed. Then the
    governor’s face became grave as another thought struck him. “There
    is no disguising the fact that I have a long swim ahead of me,” he
    said resolutely._
]




------------------------------------------------------------------------


   III—GOV. YATES’ WILD DASH FROM EUROPE TO HEAD OFF THE DENEEN BOOM

[Illustration:

  _The governor rested a moment after reaching the summit of the vast
    mountain peak, and then, drawing a deep breath he put spurs to his
    horse and shot down the steep declivity, pursued by the savage
    mountain goats. The three colonels were still in an exhausted state,
    and their weight greatly retarded the speed of the gallant steed,
    yet, strange as it may seem, the descent was made in an incredibly
    short time. In ten minutes the little cavalcade rode safely out on
    the shelving beach, and the governor urged his horse boldly into the
    Atlantic Ocean. “Now, for a long swim,” said he._
]


[Illustration:

  _Fortunately, the weather was fine. The sun shone warmly and the sea
    was calm. Under these favoring conditions it was only a few days
    until the headlands of the Azores were sighted off the port beam.
    Hunger and fatigue racked the governor, but he did not stop. He
    shouted “Courage, my noble steed. The way is long, but we shall soon
    be there.” One of the colonels was revived by the cool water, and
    from his position amidships passed the days pleasantly in watching
    the wonderful dwellers of the deep as they darted hither and thither
    alongside. On the thirty-fourth day the governor sighted a low group
    of islands off to the s’uth’ard. He sniffed a moment. “The
    Bermudas,” he said. And he was right. They were the Bermudas where
    the onions come from. From this point he shaped his course nor by
    nor west, intending to land on American shores about four miles west
    of Oyster Bay. But he was thrown out of his course by adverse
    currents and strong head winds, and had to make his landing six
    miles east of Oyster Bay. Still he was not discouraged._
]


[Illustration:

  _“Home again!” shouted the governor in joyous exultation, and again
    putting spurs to his gallant steed he galloped across the
    Alleghanies, cleared the Ohio at a bound and soon saw the towering
    dome of his beloved state-house in the distance. Large throngs of
    office-holders heralded his coming with glad shouts. Ten minutes
    later he was deep in a consultation regarding his chances of heading
    off the Deneen boom._

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
